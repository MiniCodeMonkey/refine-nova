# Refine for Laravel Nova

[Refine](https://hammerstone.dev/refine/laravel/docs/main) is a powerful, visual query builder for Laravel (and Rails!)

This repository is the integration for Refine and Laravel Nova.

Refine is a paid package, currently in early access. If you would like to try it out, please send me an email at aaron@hammerstone.dev or DM me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis).
